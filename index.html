  <title>TorchTime – D&D Scheduling & Companion</title>
  <!--
    A simple, self‑contained web application for managing Dungeons & Dragons
    campaigns. This prototype demonstrates how core scheduling and campaign
    management features might work without relying on any external
    frameworks or services. All data is stored in your browser via
    localStorage. In a production setup you would replace the storage
    layer with a database and authentication provider such as Firebase or
    Supabase. See app.js for more details.
