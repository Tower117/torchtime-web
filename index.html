    <title>TorchTime â€“ D&amp;D Campaign &amp; Character Manager</title>
    <!--
      TorchTime is a lightweight single page application for managing your
      Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, characters and sessions.  The UI
      intentionally stays simple and readable, leaving plenty of room for
      embellishment should you choose to integrate a design framework or
      your own artwork.  All state is stored in localStorage so your
      progress persists between sessions.  See app.js for the bulk of
      the application logic.

           having to bundle external assets.  The icon is wrapped in a span so

      Decorative hero image.  The image file retro_art.png should depict
      a cozy tavern or fantasy scene to set the mood.  You can replace
      retro_art.png with your own artwork by dropping a file of the same
      name into this folder.  The image is wrapped in a container so it
      remains responsive across screen sizes.

      Background music.  The audio element is kept outside of the main
      content so that it can persist across page transitions.  Music
      playback is controlled via the toggle in the navigation bar.  The
      provided tavern.wav is a short sineâ€‘wave placeholder; replace it
      with a proper fantasy tavern track (e.g. CC0 or Creative Commons)
      by dropping a file named tavern.wav or tavern.mp3 into this
      directory.  The player is hidden; play/pause is handled by
      JavaScript.
